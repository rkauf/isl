# ISL
### In this repo, I'll complete the labs at the end of each chapter in [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) 

Although my code will generally follow the exercises, I hope to expand beyond the directions and will use packages like [broom](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom) instead of the suggested base R sytax. Per usual, most code will be using [tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse) packages.
